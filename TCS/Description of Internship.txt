In Task 1, I have researched the client’s industry to understand sustainability issues. 

In Task 2, I've assessed gaps and identified opportunities in your client’s sustainability efforts. 

In Task 3, I've created a comparative analysis of potential solutions and developed strong recommendations.

In Task 4, I learned how to present my solutions to the client as a value proposition.

note:
Value Proposition is a statement that will clearly define the solutions you are offering to your client and why it will solve and improve their ESG(Environment, Social and Governance) needs better than other options.
